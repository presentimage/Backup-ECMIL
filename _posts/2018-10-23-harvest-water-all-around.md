Time to investigate local meteorological authorities to ascertain annual and monthly rainfall volumes and patterns.</p><p>Calculate the the surface area of your roof. &nbsp;Multiply the length of your roof in metres by the width. &nbsp;This will give you the area in square metres and will be your rainwater catchment area.</p><p>To calculate how much rainwater can be harvested from your roof, multiply your rainfall in millimetres by your surface area of your catchment in square metres. &nbsp;The resulting number represents how many litres of water you can expect to collect. &nbsp;This figure is a reasonable guideline to expected storage.</p><p>The official monthly rainfall volumes will pinpoint&nbsp;the expected highs and lows, so if you have enough information going back three to five years, you could predict and make provision for an annual volume. &nbsp;It would be advisable to make appropriate space for annual increases too.</p><p>Having made your calculations and a reasonably conservative plan as to what this water will be used for, it’s time to consider the components for catchment and transmission to a chosen storage location. &nbsp;</p><p>Remember that this must also connect to your plan for repurposing, so a well chosen site is critical.</p><p>At this point ECMIL can supply the following:</p><span class="tve_image_frame" style="width: 100%;"><a href="http://ecmil.net/an-ecmil-roof/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img class="tve_image wp-image-5431" alt="" width="1200" height="400" title="zinc2" data-id="5431" src="//ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/zinc2.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></a></span><p>• Zincalume® A tried and tested eco friendly high performance steel for roofing or siding, with a manufacturer recommendation</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 99, 190);">‘…<em>the use of Zincalume® steel </em></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 99, 190);">for the collection of drinking water.’</span></em></p><span class="tve_image_frame" style="width: 100%;"><a href="http://ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gutas1.jpg" rel=""><img class="tve_image wp-image-4669" alt="" width="562" height="281" title="gutas" data-id="4669" src="//ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gutas1.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></a></span><p style="text-align: left;">• K-Style Aluminium guttering dirt resistant, offered in white, in .027 gauge aluminium</p><span class="tve_image_frame" style="width: 100%;"><a href="http://ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/headpipe.jpg" rel=""><img class="tve_image wp-image-4824" alt="" width="582" height="281" title="headpipe" data-id="4824" src="//ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/headpipe.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></a></span><p>• PVC piping - in convenient sizes</p><span class="tve_image_frame" style="width: 100%;"><a href="http://ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fab.033.jpg" rel=""><img class="tve_image wp-image-4352" alt="" width="600" height="200" title="fab.033" data-id="4352" style="width: 100%;" src="//ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fab.033.jpg?resolution=1920,1" data-adaptive-images="true"></a></span><p>• Custom built galvanise water tanks&nbsp;- stock sizes also available.&nbsp;</p><p>Rainwater harvesting and storage can clearly provide an invaluable amount of water.

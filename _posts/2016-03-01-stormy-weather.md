<p class="p1"><em><strong>For a corner of the planet that is perceived as having eternal sunshine, aqua blue waters and orange sunset backdrops with every dinner, we sure do have some life threatening weather issues!</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">From tropical waves to hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes and now serious discussions regarding sunamis, it could easily give you a doldrums sized headache trying to imagine all the ways you should insure yourself and your family against disaster.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Although I can't offer an answer to Acts of God, I can suggest an approach which may alleviate some seasonal worries!</em></p>
<p class="p1">Lets break the problem down into bit sized pieces!  The two main culprits are water and wind and maybe more so, water.  Its erosive and corrosive nature can render damage now and consistently until the life goes out of materials in contact with it.</p>
<p class="p1">So, what to do?  I can't stress enough the anti storm nature of 'galvanized'.
It is, without a doubt, the most reliable and sustainable roofing material.
But don't stop there.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/plyco.035.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4368" src="http://ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/plyco.035.jpg" alt="plyco.035" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">This multi purpose material can be used for siding of sheds and outhouses, gates and any manner of situations where coverage combined with protection is an issue.  Yes, the radiated heat factor can be a consideration, but adequate use of Ply-foil insulation and inexpensive soffit or roof vents can resolve those issues.
If you have a timber or metal frame and want to clad it, consider galvanized roofing material.</p>

Contact one of ECMIL's highly experienced sales staff.  They will suggest how the product could be used and answer any technical questions.

I've approached the subject of getting water away from your largest investment, in the past, so I will only affirm that good guttering and drains are a must for this region, especially in this season.  But really, it's not picky to keep your drains clear, sweep up after the weed eater has passed, don't assume that because you invested in those fancy mesh gutter guards that debris is not still in the gutter!  Don't let the latest tropical wave wash them for you.  Pick a dry day.  And if you can, get on a steady step ladder and run the hose in your gutters.  Keep the system clean!
<p class="p1"><a href="http://ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fabwtanks.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4680 size-full" src="http://ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fabwtanks.png" alt="fabwtanks" width="226" height="236" /></a>I suppose that with all of those black plastic water tanks around, we have forgotten that welded galvanize tanks have an amazing life expectancy, attach to your existing system and do all the things that those plastic ones do, but can withstand much greater winds to protect your greatest asset after the storm, your stored water supply.</p>
<p class="p1">Not to mention that the tank can be customized to fit any space and shape, unlike its plastic counterparts' standard sizes.</p>
<p class="p1">ECMIL has been supplying custom built water tanks to the region for a great many years.  They have never replaced one yet!</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>As a side note, when you are sensibly purchasing your bulk materials to begin construction and you have decided to purchase one of ECMIL's tanks, remember to purchase the PVC and CPVC piping to go with the system.</em></span></p>
<p class="p1">So check your roof, tighten or replace screws, add appropriate siding or roofing, clean gutters and drains and when that bad weather starts to threaten, get indoors and watch that 1943 musical "Stormy Weather" with Lena Horne singing the title song, leaving the real storm safely outside.</p>

post_excerpt: >
  The Caribbean presents its own
  particular characteristics when it comes
  to shipping. Many years ago, the
  schooner was Queen of the Caribbean
  Seas, all under sail, moving cargo and
  commerce between islands. As shipping
  became bigger and more polarized, the
  container and flat rack became the order
  of the day, changing the face of
  shipping, ports and timely delivery
  forever.

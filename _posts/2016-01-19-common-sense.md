I'm the proud owner of an ECMIL Spanish Tile Roof. A beautiful Teal Hip style roof with all the trimmings. When my wife and I decided to build, we became instantly aware of everyone else's roof - the colours, accessories, profiles and shapes. The complexities were astounding! and with a little research, we realized that, in many cases, the function of the covering was being given second place to the form and style. The primary function is to protect what is inside. This begins with the very tropical issues of water and wind.

A well secured roof which is dynamically sound is part of the answer, but how the roof sheds water and where that water goes afterwards, is of extreme importance at the very earliest stage of planning. Avoid stylistic nuances such as unnecessary 'valleys' and multi roof combos; many draftsman or architects think of form before function, so keep asking yourself "where is the water going?" Make a plan for roof water and its eventual destination. Think of the environment you are about to live in. If you live in Bequia for example, water is gold, so consider how you might plan roof water harvesting. In a more lush environment like Soufriere, St. Lucia, you could be at risk from creating erosion with uncontrolled roof water eating away your land, valuable top soil and causing damage to concrete walls, pathways and fences over time.

The key to it all is to ask and sometimes press the point at the design stage. ECMIL has a staff who are knowledgeable, a huge benefit to a home owner. Experience counts when you are orchestrating your single most important investment. Using the right materials to combat the ravages of Caribbean weather, combined with good advice and common sense in construction, will turn your house into a home and your investment into a durable asset.

<h3 class="tve_p_center" style="line-height: 38px;" data-css="tve-u-163900b2f91"><span class="tve_custom_font_size" style="font-size: 25px;">When you build, there is no escaping the number of players involved.Scale, complexity, quality and budget, are the factors which determine just how many.</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;" data-unit="px">Civil projects tend to use many separate contractors for different trades, coordinated by project managers, whereas in the private sector, a project is often managed completely by the builder, with trades being represented by individually contracted tradesmen, or by multi skilled members of the contractors’s company.</p>

<h2 class="tve_p_center" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;" data-css="tve-u-163900becf6">It often takes a good eye to choose the right caliber of contractor for your job because in construction, it’s experience that matters.</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;" data-unit="px">We now have a combination of new tools, theory and qualifications, given credence by experience. You can spot it in attitude, attention to detail, consideration for the customer’s wishes, respect for budgets and materials.</p>
<span class="tve_image_frame"><img class="tve_image" style="width: 1020px;" src="//ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="272" /></span>
<h2 class="tve_p_center" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;" data-css="tve-u-163900cc8aa"><span class="tve_custom_font_size" data-css="tve-u-163900cc8af">At ECMIL, we have always considered ourselves as the supply chain to contractors.</span></h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;" data-unit="px" data-css="tve-u-163900d7561">As such, we produce a comprehensive range of items, which surpass international performance standards and are available as consolidated orders, so that all the parts arrive simultaneously, to get the project truly started.</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;" data-unit="px">From foundation rebar, welded mesh and steel for columns, to environmentally friendly and highly attractive corrugated roof sheeting and accessories, the PVC which carries the water away and the storage tanks which collect it, we supply a complete selection of building components.</p>
<span class="tve_image_frame"><img class="tve_image" style="width: 1020px;" src="//ecmil.net/master/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/triple.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="272" /></span>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;" data-unit="px">The logistics of a typical order for materials requires the ability to interpret the customer’s request, precision manufacture and a true sense of timing. Shipping between the islands can often be affected by a great many factors, including weather and maintenance, so our turnaround experience is critical to delivery.</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;" data-unit="px">From the final drawings and bill of quantities, to the choice of builder, ECMIL’s role is to advise and supply our clients with the best possible combination of materials, at extremely competitive prices, to assist in making that ‘experienced contractor’s’ job, organised, efficient and successful.</p>

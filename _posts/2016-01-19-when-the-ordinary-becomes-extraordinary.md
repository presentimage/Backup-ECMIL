<p class="p1"><strong><em>It is remarkable just how much work a wheelbarrow can do
and for that matter, how much of a distance it travels!</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">For a mason, it is the vehicle of choice, carrying cement, blocks, sand and ready mix, even concrete or plaster, often across a vast array of make shift bridges constructed from 12 by 1 casting boards to the latest destination during construction.</p>
<p class="p1">What makes this possible without disaster?  The rubber tyre, as it bounces over different heights and imperfections in its path.</p>
<p class="p1">For carpenters, plumbers and electricians the humble wheelbarrow plays an equally critical role as the single most important utility tool on any building site.</p>
<p class="p2">A solid construction enables a wheelbarrow to achieve its primary goal with dry and wet cargo.  This is where steel plays such an important part.  This often ignored vessel will be bashed, bumped, dropped from a great height and stressed beyond belief, all in the name of construction.  The rubber and wooden varieties are for light gardening - practical, if somewhat cosmetic.  A steel constructed wheelbarrow will make it through the building process, to endure the indignity of removing the last of the site garbage, only to become the home owner's friend and favorite garden companion.</p>
<p class="p2"><em>An important side bar to this is that you should never lend your wheelbarrow.  It will be like losing your right arm during the time it's gone and will somehow never be the same again when it returns!</em></p>
<p class="p2">So if prudence be your principle, never disregard the importance of simple devices.  When we decided to order our Spanish Tile roof from ECMIL, along with custom built burglar bars, guttering and chain link fencing, we bought two wheelbarrows, with steel reinforced metal pans, steel frames and pneumatic wheels.  Years after construction and many jobs later, they are still going strong!  They are our trusty laborers to whom we owe a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p class="p2">Maybe one day I 'll re-spray them.</p>

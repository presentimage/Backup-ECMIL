<p class="p1">The make or break of a new house is often down to the colour of its roof and walls. Over the years of living in the Caribbean, we have all witnessed the highs and lows!</p>
<p class="p1">To bring out the best in your newly designed future home and to avoid disappointment later, take into consideration the environment, where your house is located.  Is it a predominantly rural or urban setting?  What roof colours already exist?  What are the colours that least appeal to you?  Do you want to blend in, or make a bold statement?  Answering these simple questions will begin the process of formulating your colour palette.</p>
<p class="p2">Take a long hard look at ECMIL's colour choices.  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://ecmil.net/pdfs/ECMILcolours2014.pdf">Download the .pdf</a></span> file from ecmil.net, print them and hold them next to your house plans and elevations.  It's balanced, contrasting or complimentary colour that we are looking for here.  Fashion is bright and new, but transient.  A colour which brings out the best, reveals the greatest character of your home's features - a colour which is for all seasons across many years!  Remember to consider the colour of the walls.</p>
<p class="p2">Always look for the subtleties in a single story ranch style home.  It settles into the landscape, so Pale Terracotta, Pale Euclytt, Auqamarine or Torres Blue will brighten up darker walls, whereas Teal or Copper Penny will balance and contrast a stronger, richer wall colour.</p>
<p class="p1">A two story home with lighter walls makes a strong statement, so imperial Orange, Monica Red, Manor Red or Blue Brook will reinforce this character.</p>
<p class="p1">If your home is unpainted or stained timber, or stone, consider Teal or Pale Terracotta.  This combination has a very natural appearance and compliments the environment.</p>
<p class="p2">Don't stop your creativity now!  Accessorize!  Your facia boards, clean white K-Style guttering and down pipes were made to stylishly highlight the transition between roof and walls.  If you are really brave and want to add a 'signature' flair to your roof, consider a contrasting flashing and ridge cap colour.  There's nothing wrong with creating visual interest and colourful highlights on a single colour roof.  Remember, in an island environment where houses often do not have street numbers, "the house with the dark green roof and the orange flashing" will stand out and give instant directions!</p>
<p class="p2">Whatever you choose, remember that your castle will be covered by your roof colour choice for a great many years, so embrace your desire for colour and stand out from the rest of the street, with subtlety or with a punch, make your statement and colour your home to make it yours.</p>

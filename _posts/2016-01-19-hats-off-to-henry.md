<p class="p1"><em><strong>Just staring at my Spanish Tile roof, it's enlightening to consider the cultural significance of the material and the history that it carries.</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">So with a little research I discovered that 'Corrugated galvanized iron' or 'CGI' (it was originally made from wrought iron), was invented in the 1820s by a British architect and engineer named Henry Palmer, for the London Dock Company.</p>
<p class="p1">It was light, strong and easily transported and therefore lent itself to prefabricated structures and considerable improvisation by unskilled or semi-skilled workers.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With these properties and its ease of use, it became the construction material of choice, especially in rural areas of the </span>United States, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, India and the Caribbean.  In fact in New Zealand, Australia and the Caribbean it has become so much part of the cultural identity, that stylish architectural use has become common in urban and rural areas, creating consumer demand for infinite variation.</p>
<p class="p2">It is remarkable to consider that one seemingly simple invention could have done so much in the development of so many countries and cultures, become so fashionable as to have such a vast range of colours, styles, accessories and finishes and played such a central role in assisting the common man find shelter, business and dignity.</p>
<p class="p2">From grand public buildings to gingerbread and chattel houses, the humble 'long drop' and banana shed, dog kennel, fence or wall, "<em>galvanize</em>" has protected us from all the elements, in a particularly economical way.</p>
<p class="p2">Coverage has always been the problem, and the expense.  Galvanized roofing resolves that and with such innovations as insulation foil, the all pervasive question of temperature begins to be addressed too.  It warms my heart, as a designer, that material manufacturers to the construction industry, continue to develop the simplest of things, which will inevitably create the greatest social impact to all of us;  better screws, better shapes, more resistant surfaces and cutting tools.</p>
<p class="p2">As laymen we are all steeped in outcomes, not mechanics.  So, it's the shape, the colour and the finish that makes us stare.</p>
<p class="p1">The clever people at ECMIL helped me choose, gave me advice, delivered a product for which Henry would be justly proud, at an economical price, kept our castle secure and continued a successful 200 year old tradition with a familiar friend.</p>
<p class="p2">Thanks for your vision Henry!</p>

post_excerpt: >
  The words Steel and Reinforcement are
  almost interchangeable and the
  combination of concrete and steel,
  inseparable. From bridges and roads to
  foundations and pathways, steel is
  present in many forms and variations,
  performing reliably, to meet the ever
  evolving needs of engineers, architects
  and builders.

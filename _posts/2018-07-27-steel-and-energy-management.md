Many of them are of poor quality, brittle and untrustworthy for the purposes for which they were created. &nbsp;This can often mean the difference between life and death, when the product is a few dollars less!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span data-css="tve-u-164dd526aba" style="color: rgb(0, 99, 190);">At ECMIL, our focus is always on a quality product, which meets the needs of our region.</span></strong></p><p>The source of our steel is tried and tested over more than a century.

<strong><em>All of our efforts in this ever changing world, appear to focus on keeping and hopefully improving what we have accrued.</em></strong>

We save and spend, although often not in equal measure, to collect the items from which we not only derive pleasure, but somehow define us and our lives.  As that definition evolves, so does our 'stuff'.  Where we put it is often a burden, but coupled to this, is the question of how we protect it.

I am a great believer in fences and gates.  They really do define our space.
They draw a definitive line around our world, which speaks volumes to those on the perimeter.  They marshal 'strays' into certain areas and protect others from prying eyes.

I like chain link fencing.  I enjoyed building ours, all 380 feet of it and still feel that our property is not as secluded or cut-off as a wall would have made it.

The process of chain-link fencing manufacture was developed in 1844, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich">Norwich</a>, England, by Charles Barnard, using a machine based on cloth weaving.  To me, it somehow carries an industrial uniformity which is found in the best of cloth, without being soft; chain link looks like what it does.

I have heard many comments over the years, suggesting that chain link is "too temporary", not having the 'majesty' of a stone or block wall, or even the 'style' of a wooden fence.  I would beg to differ.  All too often we build with little regard for the area that surrounds our property, throwing up stone or concrete block walls, as if screaming "This is mine...and it's my castle!"  Your castle it most certainly is, but generally you don't require security equal to or passing the FBI headquarters at Quantico, or the Tower of London.  It's often grandiose, dwarfs or detracts from the house and the area and in the final analysis, can be way too expensive. Interestingly enough, it was brought to my attention that a wall, once scaled, easily hides an intruder from the road, whereas chain link allows for greater vision, with security.

It comes in many sizes, dependent upon the manufacturer.  ECMIL can provide galvanized chain link fencing wire in 4′, 5′ &amp; 6′ wide rolls, 2.65mm gauge, 75′ in length.

For a perimeter fence, 6' is ideal.  We set our 2" upright poles at 8' centres, bringing the fence line 1' in from the boundary and adding top rails (1.5") and angled corner supports.  We also cast a low footing between posts, which grips the chain link at the base.

All things considered, chain link offers a different perspective.  It defines and protects your space with a light, airy feel, while making your boundaries appear clean and tidy.  It's also economical, quick to put up and to replace.  It is to be noted that the combination of concrete gate posts, a custom built decorative gate, fabrication courtesy ECMIL chain link fencing and barbed wire, will give you the best of all worlds, with a substantial upgrade to your security.

There are as many ways to setup a chain link fence as there are contractors to do it, so choose wisely if you don't do it yourself.  And even if you do, before you do, call ECMIL for the right materials and experienced advice.

<p class="p1"><strong><em><strong>Wouldn't it be nice to control the price of your building process?</strong></em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">An experienced eye for materials, good initial estimation and well conceived Bill of Quantities are essential.  Equally, a contractor who sees the value in reducing waste and being frugal, will assist in body swerving an impending overrun bill, which is the single biggest holdup to home completion.</p>
<p class="p1">So what can we do as clients?  Do we just bite the bullet, say "in God we trust" and be the silent partner in a potential financial trauma, just waiting to happen?</p>
<p class="p1">There are many ways in which the client can manage the construction process, to thwart willful disregard of 'your' materials.</p>
<p class="p1">If humanly possible, be present at the major events of the process and stand firm; cutting of the land - <em>"where is my top soil going to be stored?"</em>  Delivery of local materials such as blocks - <em>"is that a 1,000 blocks and why are those ones broken?"</em>  Delivery of lumber and plywood - <em>"why do those 2 x 6s look warped?"</em> You get my point!</p>
<p class="p1">Bulk purchase prior to construction will always save.  Rebar for foundations and columns, welded mesh for floors and stairs, nails for general construction and casting forms, hot and cold water CPVC and PVC piping and electrical conduit, even sturdy wheelbarrows for the movement of everything from earth, bags of cement, concrete and even garbage.  If it fits in a container and can be left on site for the duration, it will facilitate a rapid start to building, become your lockup and your first defense against inevitable larceny and above all, as a consolidated shipment, save you valuable dollars during one of the largest financial commitments in your life.</p>
<p class="p1">ECMIL can do this for you, from steel to PVC piping, rolls of roofing insulation, guttering and accessories, your Colorcoat roof and even custom fabrication such as burglar bars.  They can pack it to suit your needs and deliver in a container or on a palette to your requirements.  As a side bar, the on-island agents for your container will give you a short grace period prior to return, with the possibility of rental for the duration of your requirement.  So find out who the agent is from your supplier and make the call.  It will save you time and headaches down the road.</p>
<p class="p1">Discuss all of these issues with your builder, architect and with an ECMIL representative, ask questions, make a plan and an order of events and save yourself and your valued project from unnecessary waste, from the earliest stage of production.</p>
<p class="p1">Great construction stories come from good plans, partners, supply and better execution.  In as much as others supply and build for you, getting involved pays dividends and stretches your budget, so you maximize your opportunity for a timely entry to your brand new home.</p>

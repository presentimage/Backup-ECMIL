Galvanised sheet metal is most common.</p><p>Flashing is formed from flat steel into various shapes, depending upon the job it must do. The main types of roof flashing handle <strong>Roof Valleys</strong>, where two roof planes meet, <strong>Drip edges</strong> preventing water from seeping under roofing along the edges of rakes and eaves, <strong>skylights</strong> and <strong>dormers,</strong> where difficult angles meet the main roof sheeting. &nbsp;</p><p>They also seal various architectural elements, such as vent pipes, which protrude from the roof surface, often with two or more competing materials. &nbsp;</p><p>The combination of <a href="https://ecmil.net/roof-accessories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: rgb(54, 91, 177);">universal bat proofing</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ecmil.net/roof-accessories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: rgb(54, 91, 177);">sealant tape</span></a>, silicone and other water resistant sealants, assist flashing in creating a long lasting barrier.</p><p>Ridge caps are equally part of the flashing family, covering and protecting the join between two or more roof planes, be they at the apex of the roof, or at the each hip of a complex combination of dimensions.</p><p>In the world of complex structures with many variables, custom flashing permutations of shape and size are seemingly endless.</p><p>But in an average construction, many standard shapes apply, making the roof design do what it's supposed to, protecting the contents of the building from the ravages of the elements, whether water, wind or sunshine.</p><p>Flashing, in its best use, serves to control those forces of nature by directing and managing, otherwise uncontrollable wind and water.</p><p>Gladly, exposed rafter roof design has given rise to the general use of T111 boarding, as a protective layer and sound barrier, allowing for <a href="https://ecmil.net/roof-accessories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: rgb(54, 91, 177);">Plyco® Ply-Foil Roofing Insulation</span></a> to be placed underneath galvanised roof sheeting. &nbsp;This also gives a firm base for accurate positioning of flashing at various critical points of the roof construction, while not compromising the heat blocking membrane.</p><p>At ECMIL we are extremely experienced in finding the right size, shape, function and structure of all of your flashing requirements.</p><p>Once you provide us with your roof drawings and elevations, we will calculate all of your requirements and work with you, or your architect, to supply the best possible combination of flashing, matched perfectly in colour and style to your sheet profile, adding durability to your roof installation.</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(54, 91, 177);">Contact your ECMIL sales representative today&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(54, 91, 177);"></span><strong><span style="color: rgb(54, 91, 177);">and discover how quality Flashing will protect your home.</span></strong></p><span></span><p><em><em>NB.
